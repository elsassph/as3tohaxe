as3tohaxe - An Actionscript 3 to haXe source file converter written in Haskell
Copyright (C) 2008-2009 Don-Duong Quach

This is NOT a complete converter.  It is not possible for haXe to override the
getters and setters of native Flash classes (e.g. Sprite), so converting your
as3 code to haxe completely is not possible as far as I know.  

So I stopped working on the project, but the code and executable may still be 
useful to someone.

-- Running --
Type 'as3tohaxe' and a directory or file to convert.  
A directory named "hx_output" will be created in the current
directory if necessary.  The supplied ".as" files will be 
translated into haxe files and stored there.  If the command
is run more than once, and pre-existing files will be overwritten.

-- Binary --
Binaries for Mac OSX Leopard and Windows are available under 
the Files section of the as3tohaxe google group.
